Personal Profile
#################

My name is Sara. I am the Retail Trainer & Professional Development Manager at a local community bank. My primary role is to provide regulatory and technical training to all employees. In community banking you wear a lot of hats. It’s common for bank trainers to also act as the technical writer for their bank. And so at my bank I also author and edit all policies, procedures, and manuals.

It has been a challenge for me to find training how to write procedures and manuals. In the banking industry we have plenty of courses on business writing and financial writing, but not on technical writing. I struggle most with how to format procedures. I don’t think my procedures are displayed in the best way possible for easy reading. I am hoping this course will provide insight into this.


* I have a beef with the IT department.
* I HATE Windows 10.
* I have a second job.
* I have a lot of fun with all my coworkers.
